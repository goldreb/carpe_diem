# carpe_diem
This is our first project for University of Oregon coding bootcamp.

## About the Project
**Carpe Diem**
Developed as a vehicle to enhance your overall productivity throughout the day. We start the day by strategizing our daily tasks! Along with a chuckle or two from our “useless,” yet hilarious facts. We also included a quote to make you stop and think.
Completing smaller tasks is proven to provide a sense of accomplishment, enough to propel you forward in getting you closer to your goals.
